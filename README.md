### Creative Digital Art Classroom
## Coding Skills and Web Languages for Building Your Own Website
## Final Project

In this project you are required to create a static website as your personal portfolio.

Your website should contain the following information:
* design a header with either a personal photo or an avatar as your identification. You could use [these designs](www.google.com/search?q=personal+icon&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiwj-fEwMvuAhXazIsBHXu9AhMQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=personal+icon&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BQgAELEDOggIABCxAxCDAToECAAQQzoHCAAQsQMQQ1Cfc1j3lwFgw6wBaABwAHgAgAFiiAG1BpIBAjEzmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=H24ZYPCDJdqZr7wP-_qKmAE&bih=521&biw=1263&hl=en) as a reference; however, copying is strictly prohibited.
* use a common horizontal or vertical navigation panel,
* create a gallery using either some of your photos or your own artworks, 
- create a footer with the appropriate copyright information (Sharing is not required!).
Please note that 
- your design should be responsive (automatically adjust to the width of the screen) and
- your design should be accessible.
More details are provided in the assignment slides in Google Classroom.
